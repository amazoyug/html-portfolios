<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a highly motivated Software Engineering student at University Putra Malaysia (UPM) with a strong academic background, achieving a CGPA of 3.88 and earning a place on the Deanâ€™s List. 
   My passion for technology and innovation drives me to explore how software solutions can enhance efficiency and improve user experiences.
   I have a solid foundation in programming, web development, and database management, with proficiency in Python, Java, HTML, CSS, and MySQL. 
   Beyond coding, I am keen on UI/UX design and software prototyping, ensuring that technology is not only functional but also user-friendly.
</p>

<p>My experiences extend beyond academics into customer service and retail, where I developed strong interpersonal and problem-solving skills.
  Working at EconSave allowed me to improve my ability to adapt in fast-paced environments, optimize workflows, and collaborate with diverse teams. 
  Additionally, leading a large-scale futsal tournament at UPM refined my leadership, coordination, and project management skills, 
  teaching me how to balance technical expertise with teamwork and organization.

<p>Driven by a continuous desire for learning and professional growth, I actively seek opportunities to apply my knowledge in real-world projects. 
  My coursework and personal projects have strengthened my ability to develop software solutions that address real business challenges, 
  including an inventory management system prototype that showcased my database and UI/UX design skills. 
  I am eager to gain hands-on experience in the tech industry, contribute to meaningful projects, and develop innovative solutions that create a lasting impact.
